Across Michigan, there are few facilities like the Regional Manufacturing Technology Center (RMTC), which KCC started in 1990 as a way to serve the workforce needs of the industries that are active and growing in south central Michigan. Thanks to an ongoing commitment from the College, private employers and local, state and federal agencies, the RMTC is a premier provider of industrial and skilled-trades education with highly experienced instructors and top-notch equipment. Machinery used for training at the RMTC is similar or identical to the equipment that students will use in the workplace.

The facility is home to KCC's <strong><a href="/industrial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Industrial Trades programs</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/business-industry/workforcesolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workforce Solutions</a>.</strong> The RMTC is an innovative, community-driven training facility in the Fort Custer Industrial Park in Battle Creek where these departments design training programs using blended learning techniques.
