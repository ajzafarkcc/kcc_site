Although the RMTC utilizes a nontraditional instructional method, becoming a student is a straightforward, three-step process. Thanks to our non-traditional, Open Entry Open Exit style of teaching, students can begin coursework immediately upon registration.

With a little preparation, the entire process can be completed in a single day with one approximately hour-long visit to the RMTC. Our staff can assist with any part of the process, in person or by phone at 269-965-4137.
<h2 id="apply">Apply to Kellogg Community College</h2>
The first step is to <strong><a href="/apply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply to KCC</a></strong> as any other student. As part of the college's processes, we do require photo ID and proof of address (a driver's license can be both) before students can register for modules.

Admission is open to anyone who either:
<ul>
  <li>is 18 years of age or older;</li>
  <li>has finished a high school diploma, an equivalency like the GED, or a home school program; or</li>
  <li>desires to participate in a <strong><a href="/academics/departments/industrial-trades/youth-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dual enrollment or early college program</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="orientation">Complete Orientation</h2>
After applying to KCC, peruse <strong><a href="/academics/departments/industrial-trades/orientation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our orientation page</a></strong> and visit the RMTC to meet with an instructor in your chosen program(s) to learn more about the program and outline a selection of modules that suits your needs. Once done, our staff can record the orientation, enabling registration for modules.
<h2 id="register">Register for Modules</h2>
With orientation completed and proof of address supplied, our staff is more than willing to register students in person. However, KCC requires payment for courses within 24 hours of registration, whether that's out of pocket, <strong><a href="/admissions/financial-aid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using financial aid</a>,</strong> or through a <strong><a href="/academics/departments/industrial-trades/companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company sponsorship</a>.</strong> Financial aid students must also <strong><a href="https://portal.kellogg.edu/Student/Finance/NelnetPayments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enroll in a payment plan</a>.</strong>
