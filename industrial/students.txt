Although the RMTC utilizes a nontraditional instructional method, becoming a student is a straightforward, three-step process. Thanks to our non-traditional, Open Entry Open Exit style of teaching, students can begin coursework immediately upon registration.

With a little preparation, the entire process can be completed in a single day with a single roughly hour-long visit to the RMTC.Our staff can assist with any part of the process, in person or by phone at 269-965-4137.
<h2 id="apply">Apply to Kellogg Community College</h2>
The first step is to <strong><a href="/apply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply to KCC</a></strong> as any other student. As part of the college's processes, we do require photo ID and proof of address before students can register for modules.
Every applicant must:
<ul>
 	<li>be 18 years of age or older,</li>
 	<li>obtained a high school diploma or equivalent (GED), or</li>
 	<li>finished a home school program.</li>
</ul>
We do also accept <strong><a href="/academics/departments/industrial-trades/youth-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dual enrolled students</a>.</strong>
<h2 id="orientation">Complete Orientation</h2>
After applying to KCC, peruse <strong><a href="/academics/departments/industrial-trades/orientation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our orientation page</a></strong> and visit the RMTC to meet with an instructor in your chosen program(s) to learn more about the program and outline a selection of modules that suits your needs. Once done, our staff can record the orientation, enabling registration for modules.
<h2 id="register">Register for Modules</h2>
With orientation completed and proof of address supplied, students are free to register for modules via the <strong><a href="https://portal.kellogg.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruin portal</a> (<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Registration-Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Registration Guide</a>).</strong> Alternatively our staff are more than willing to register students in person.

In all cases, KCC requires payment for courses within 24 hours of registration, whether that's out of pocket, <strong><a href="/admissions/financial-aid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using financial aid</a>,</strong> or through a <strong><a href="/academics/departments/industrial-trades/companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company sponsorship</a>.</strong> Staff must verify payment is made in order to register students as well. Financial aid students must also <strong><a href="https://portal.kellogg.edu/Student/Finance/NelnetPayments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enroll in a payment plan</a>.</strong>
