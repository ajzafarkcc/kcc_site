<h2>Course Sequences</h2>
Unlike traditional academic courses, the offerings in KCC's Industrial Electricity and Electronics Program&nbsp;consist of short modules that are components of larger units. Modules are often less than 1 credit apiece and can be completed at a student’s own pace in a matter of hours or days. Units range from one to 30 modules, depending on the area of instruction.

Industrial Electricity and Electronics modules carry the course designator INEL as detailed in the most recent <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FA21-Electricity-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall 2021 Industrial Electricity/Electronics cost sheet.</a></strong> Units in this program include:

<h2>Why Study Industrial Electricity &amp; Electronics at KCC?</h2>
Electricians work for companies, private contractors and themselves in a variety of residential, commercial and industrial settings, including homes, schools, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, shopping centers, office buildings and apartment complexes. Industrial electricians work in manufacturing facilities on high-tech machines and automated equipment.
<h3>RMTC Equipment &amp; Facilities</h3>
Across Michigan, there are few facilities like the Regional Manufacturing Technology Center, which KCC started in 1990 as a way to serve the workforce needs of the industries that are active and growing in south central Michigan. Thanks to an ongoing commitment from the College, private employers and local, state and federal agencies, the RMTC is a premier provider of industrial and skilled-trades education with highly experienced instructors and top-notch equipment. Machinery used for training at the RMTC is similar or identical to the equipment that students will use in the workplace.
<h3>Self-Paced Learning</h3>
Because of the self-paced instructional model at the RMTC, students can move at their own pace through the modules and units. As their work and life schedules allow, they can spend as many or as few hours each week learning alongside our instructors, who are available during lab hours<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>

Please see the <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RMTC-Fall-2021-Lab-Schedule-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RMTC Fall 2021 Lab Schedule</a></strong><b>&nbsp;</b>for current lab and resource room availability.
<h3>Prior-Learning Credits</h3>
Students who hold a journeyman or U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) apprenticeship certificate are eligible to receive prior learning credits that can be applied toward a KCC certificate or degree.
<h3>Tour the RMTC</h3>
Prospective students have an open invitation to visit the RMTC to take a tour of the facility, meet instructors and learn more about individual programs.
