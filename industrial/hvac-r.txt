The Industrial Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC-R) Program at Kellogg Community College prepares students to install, maintain and repair these systems.

KCC offers the following Industrial HVAC-R&nbsp;Program credentials:
<ul>
 	<li>Industrial Trades Certificate in HVAC-R (25 credits)</li>
 	<li>Associate in Applied Science: Industrial HVAC-R (60 credits)</li>
 	<li>Associate in Applied Science: Skilled Trades (60 credits)</li>

<h2>Course Sequences</h2>
Unlike traditional academic courses, the offerings in KCC's Industrial HVAC-R Program consist of short modules that are components of larger units. Modules are often less than 1 credit apiece and can be completed at a student’s own pace in a matter of hours or days. Units range from one to 30 modules, depending on the area of instruction.

Industrial HVAC-R modules carry the course designator INHR as detailed in the most recent <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FA21-HVACR-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall 2021 HVAC-R cost sheet.</a></strong>&nbsp;Units in this program include:

<h2>Why Study Industrial HVAC-R at KCC?</h2>
Heating and air conditioning systems are so common in modern society that the people who install, maintain and repair those systems will have abundant work opportunities for generations to come. In a sense, the HVAC-R industry is recession-resistant because heating and air conditioning are considered necessities in most settings and the work associated with these systems must be performed by local experts. The work is hands-on and no two days are alike.
<h3>RMTC Equipment &amp; Facilities</h3>
Across Michigan, there are few facilities like the Regional Manufacturing Technology Center, which KCC started in 1990 as a way to serve the workforce needs of the industries that are active and growing in south central Michigan. Thanks to an ongoing commitment from the College, private employers and local, state and federal agencies, the RMTC is a premier provider of industrial and skilled-trades education with highly experienced instructors and top-notch equipment. Machinery used for training at the RMTC is similar or identical to the equipment that students will use in the workplace.&nbsp;Additionally, KCC's HVAC-R Program has one of the only low-pressure refrigerant trainers in Michigan. The College purchased the trainer with a federal grant.
<h3>Self-Paced Learning</h3>
Because of the self-paced instructional model at the RMTC, students can move at their own pace through the modules and units. As their work and life schedules allow, they can spend as many or as few hours each week learning alongside our instructors, who are available in labs during lab hours.

See the <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RMTC-Fall-2021-Lab-Schedule-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RMTC Fall 2021 Lab Schedule</a> </strong>for available hours.
<h3>Prior-Learning Credits</h3>
Students who hold a journeyman or U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) apprenticeship certificate are eligible to receive prior learning credits that can be applied toward a KCC certificate or degree.
<h3>Tour the RMTC</h3>
Prospective students have an open invitation to visit the RMTC to take a tour of the facility, meet instructors and learn more about individual programs.
