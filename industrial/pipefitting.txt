Many piping systems are regulated by automatic controls which are accessed remotely. The Industrial Pipefitting Program at Kellogg Community College prepares students to install, maintain and repair such systems.

KCC offers the following Industrial Pipefitting Program credentials:
<ul>
 	<li>Industrial Trades certificate in Pipefitting (25 credits)</li>
 	<li>Associate in Applied Science: Industrial Pipefitting (60 credits)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Sequences</h2>
Unlike traditional academic courses, the offerings in this program consist of short modules that are components of larger units. Modules are often less than 1 credit apiece and can be completed at a student’s own pace in a matter of hours or days. Units range from one to 30 modules, depending on the area of instruction.

Industrial Pipefitting modules carry the course designator INPF as detailed in the most recent <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FA21-Pipefitting.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall 2021 Pipefitting Cost Sheet.</a></strong> Units in this program include:

<h2>Why Study Industrial Pipefitting at KCC?</h2>
<h3>RMTC Equipment &amp; Facilities</h3>
Across Michigan, there are few facilities like the Regional Manufacturing Technology Center, which KCC started in 1990 as a way to serve the workforce needs of the industries that are active and growing in south central Michigan. Thanks to an ongoing commitment from the College, private employers and local, state and federal agencies, the RMTC is a premier provider of industrial and skilled-trades education with highly experienced instructors and top-notch equipment. Machinery used for training at the RMTC is similar or identical to the equipment that students will use in the workplace.

Because of the self-paced instructional model at the RMTC, students can move at their own pace through the modules and units. As their work and life schedules allow, they can spend as many or as few hours each week learning alongside our instructors, who are available in labs day and night.
