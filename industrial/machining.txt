These highly skilled experts work with designers and engineers to make fixtures, dies, molds, gauges and other industry-specific parts which support the manufacturing process.

The Industrial Machining Technology Program at Kellogg Community College prepares students with hands-on skills to create precision components.

KCC offers the following Industrial Machining Technology Program credentials:
<ul>
 	<li>Industrial Machining Technology Certificate (30 credits)</li>
 	<li>Associate in Applied Science: Industrial Machining Technology (60 credits)</li>
 	<li>Associate in Applied Science: Skilled Trades (60 credits)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Sequences</h2>
Unlike traditional academic courses, the offerings in KCC's&nbsp;Industrial Machining Technology&nbsp;Program consist of short modules that are components of larger units. Modules are often less than 1 credit apiece and can be completed at a student’s own pace in a matter of hours or days. Units range from one to 30 modules, depending on the area of instruction.

Industrial Machining Technology modules carry the course designator INMT as detailed in the most recent <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FA21-Machining-Technology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall 2021 Machining Technology Cost Sheet.</a> </strong>Units in this program include:

<h2>Why Study Industrial Machining&nbsp;Technology at KCC?</h2>
The skills that KCC students learn and practice matter greatly to industries across the world. The ships on the sea, the planes in the air and the satellites in space were all made by tradespeople. At KCC, we take seriously the quality, accuracy, technology and safety of the techniques and mechanical thinking that we teach.
<h3>Tool &amp; Die Modules</h3>
Our&nbsp;Tool and Die modules are&nbsp;designed for company-sponsored students who are working as machinists or toolmakers. Our&nbsp;Tool and Die instructor will work with the student or company to find specific modules within the Tool and Die curriculum which will best serve the student’s individual needs. Students will learn how to heat-treat steel and how to design and make jigs, fixtures, gages, dies and molds.

Tool and Die modules are not offered during summer semesters.</strong>
<h3>RMTC Equipment &amp; Facilities</h3>
Across Michigan, there are few facilities like the Regional Manufacturing Technology Center, which KCC started in 1990 as a way to serve the workforce needs of the industries that are active and growing in south central Michigan. Thanks to an ongoing commitment from the College, private employers and local, state and federal agencies, the RMTC is a premier provider of industrial and skilled-trades education with highly experienced instructors and top-notch equipment. Machinery used for training at the RMTC is similar or identical to the equipment that students will use in the workplace.
<h3>Self-Paced Learning</h3>
Because of the self-paced instructional model at the RMTC, students can move at their own pace through the modules and units. As their work and life schedules allow, they can spend as many or as few hours each week learning alongside our instructors, who are available in labs day and night.

See the <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RMTC-Fall-2021-Lab-Schedule-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RMTC Fall 2021 Lab Schedule</a>&nbsp;</strong>for available hours.
<h3>Prior-Learning Credits</h3>
Students who hold a journeyman or U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) apprenticeship certificate are eligible to receive prior learning credits that can be applied toward a KCC certificate or degree.
