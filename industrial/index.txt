    <li>The drop deadline will be approximately four weeks before the end of the semester.

    <li>Students will still be able to pursue an incomplete until the last day of the semester. However, students will be unable to register for more modules if there is an active incomplete on record.</li>

Kellogg Community College's manufacturing, skilled trades, and applied technology training primarily takes place at the Regional Manufacturing Technology Center or RMTC. The RMTC is an innovative, community-driven training facility in the Fort Custer Industrial Park in Battle Creek, Michigan with dedicated and helpful faculty and staff. The facility is also home to KCC’s <strong><a href="/business-industry/workforcesolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Workforce Solutions department</a>.</strong> Together, these departments design training programs for modern industrial businesses using blended learning techniques.

<p style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; background-color: #e5d4cb;"><strong>Our regular hours are Monday and Thursday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Tuesday and Wednesday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. See our lab schedule for <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RMTC-Spring-2022-Lab-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2022</a></strong> for information about closings.</strong></p>

<h2>Open Entry, Open Exit</h2>
The RMTC's programming approach offers an innovative, nontraditional style of training called Open Entry, Open Exit that incorporates competency-based modules, individualized instruction and self-paced learning. Additionally, students are able to register for courses at any point in the semester, and students aren't required to attend once they've completed their modules.
<h3>Short, Competency-Based Modules</h3>
Modules are short, topical courses generally between 5 and 25 clock hours in length. In some programs, modules must be taken in successive order, where students must pass each successive module before starting the next. Competency-based means students must achieve the minimum score (80, 90 or 100 percent) to pass the module. All modules earn college credit.
<h3>Individualized Instruction</h3>
Industrial Trades instruction is instructor-facilitated instead of instructor-led. Each module contains a list of learning activities which may include reading technical manuals or textbooks, watching videos, completing written exercises, completing hands-on lab activities and/or completing written or lab-based assessments&mdash;much of which is available online. Instructors provide one-on-one instruction to individual students as they work through these learning activities.
<h3>Self-Paced Learning</h3>
Students may attend at any time during open lab hours to work on their modules and learning activities at their own pace. Students may register for modules at any time during the semester. The bulk of coursework is either online or in books provided to the students by us, which can be completed anywhere and any time that suits the student.
<h2>Prior Experience</h2>
Students may be granted credit for prior learning or work experience. Many Industrial Trades students have extensive knowledge and skills, which may be equivalent to the knowledge and skills taught at the RMTC. In these cases students may apply for prior experiential credit. Students should discuss all prior learning and experience with their RMTC program instructor prior to enrollment.
<h2>Student Rights</h2>
As part of KCC, the RMTC protects students according to both <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FERPA-KCC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>FERPA</strong></a> and the <strong><a href="/safecampus/">Clery Act</a>.</strong> FERPA ensures that student information is not provided to third parties without consent from the affected students, and the Clery Act ensures a safe campus for <strong>all</strong> students.
