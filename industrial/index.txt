KCC's Industrial Trades programming is offered at the College's state-of-the-art Regional Manufacturing Technology Center (RMTC) campus, located at 405 Hill Brady Road in Battle Creek. KCC's programming approach offers an innovative, nontraditional style of training that&nbsp;incorporates competency-based modules, individualized instruction and self-paced learning. Modules are credit-based and may lead to a certificate or an Associate in Applied Science degree. Students may also be granted credit for prior learning experience.

Students who have earned an apprenticeship certificate or who possess a journeyman’s card or state license in a qualifying trade area may also have the opportunity to earn a 60-credit&nbsp;<strong>Associate in Applied Science degree in Skilled Trades.</strong> Students must seek approval from the Associate Dean of the RMTC prior to applying for graduation. For more information about this degree program, contact Julia Faist at <a href="mailto:FaistJ@kellogg.edu"><strong>FaistJ@kellogg.edu</strong></a>.
<h3>Competency-based Modules</h3>
Modules are short, topical courses generally between five&nbsp;and 25 clock hours in length. In some programs, modules must be taken in successive order, where students must pass each successive module before starting the next. Competency-based means students must achieve the minimum score (80, 90 or 100 percent) to pass the module.
<h3>Individualized Instruction</h3>
Industrial Trades instruction is instructor-facilitated instead of instructor-led. Each module contains a list of learning activities which may include reading technical manuals or textbooks, watching videos, completing online curricula, viewing presentations, completing written exercises, completing hands-on lab activities and/or completing written or lab-based assessments. Instructors provide one-on-one instruction to individual students as they work through these learning activities.
<h3>Self-Paced Learning</h3>
Students may attend at any time during open lab hours to work on their modules and learning activities at their own pace. Students may register for modules at any time during the semester.
<h3>Credit-Based</h3>
All Industrial Trades modules are credit-based, which means students earn college credit for each module successfully completed. For every 24 hours of instruction, students earn one college credit hour. Credit and contact hours for each module are listed on the program outlines/cost sheets available on the program Web pages linked above. Minimum credit requirements for certificates vary by program. A certificate is required for the completion of an Associate in Applied Science degree in Industrial Trades.
<h3>Prior Experience</h3>
Students may be granted credit for prior learning or work experience. Many Industrial Trades students have extensive knowledge and skills, which may be equivalent to the knowledge and skills taught at the RMTC. In these cases students may apply for prior experiential credit. Students should discuss all prior learning and experience with their RMTC program instructor prior to enrollment.
