<h2>Incomplete Contracts</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Module Incomplete Grades:</b> If an incomplete grade is requested for a module, students will need to work with their faculty to submit an Incomplete Contract. Here are some important things to remember about Incomplete Contracts:
<ul>
<li>As incomplete grades will no longer be automatically awarded, grades of N "No Credit" will be entered for any student with an incomplete module for which a contract is not in place. This means a student would have to register and pay for the module again in the future to continue work on it.</li>
<li>Students must connect with program faculty to complete the Incomplete Contract, and both the student and faculty must sign it. The original will be left with faculty, and the student is encouraged to keep a copy for their records. It is up to faculty discretion as to whether a student will be awarded the requested Incomplete Contract.</li>
<li>Students can download the Incomplete Contract and directions here - <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/KCC-RMTC-Incomplete-Contract-FA20.pdf">KCC RMTC Incomplete Contract</a>.</strong> To complete and submit the contract electronically, this version of the document can be typed in directly and emailed to program faculty -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RMTC-Incompete-Contract-fillable-PDF.-pdf.pdf">RMTC Incomplete Contract - fillable PDF. pdf</a> &nbsp;</strong>It is important to note that only official KCC email addresses can be used in facilitating this process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accessing Content from Past Incomplete Modules:</strong> If a student previously received an incomplete grade on a module that is listed as currently available online and would like to continue to work on it, please contact your program faculty for access.</li>
</ul>
