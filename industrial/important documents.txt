<h2 id="sponsor">Company Sponsored Students</h2>
Sponsored students and their sponsoring company must submit a <strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sponsored-Student-Billing-Authorization-Fall-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sponsored Student Billing Authorization</a></strong> in order to register for classes. If students are not going to complete modules by the end of semester date, they have the option to drop modules before the drop deadline, or speak to their instructor about doing an <a href="#incomplete"><strong>incomplete contract</strong></a> to receive incomplete grades.

In order to receive end-of-semester progress reports on sponsored students, there must be a signed <strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Email-Agreement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email Agreement form</a></strong> on file for each company representative who would like to receive a progress report. Students may obtain a copy of their progress report by contacting RMTC staff. Students can also access their unofficial course history at any time through their <strong><a href="http://portal.kellogg.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruin student portal</a>.</strong>
<h2 id="incomplete">Incomplete Contracts</h2>
If a student feels they are unable to finish one or more modules by the end of the semester, they can work with their program's respective faculty to submit an <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RMTC_Incomplete_Contract.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>incomplete contract</strong></a>. Once approved, the student will receive an I grade for Incomplete and be permitted a full year after the end of the semester to finish the module(s) on the incomplete contract. Without the incomplete contract, the student would receive an N for No Credit and be required to pay for the module(s) a second time in order to finish them.

<p style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; background-color: #e5d4cb;"></strong>Incomplete grades can have an impact on financial aid. Contact <strong><a href="/admissions/financial-aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our financial aid department</a></strong> to learn how yours could be affected.</strong></p>

Incomplete contracts can also be <strong><a href="mailto:rmtc@kellogg.edu">submitted via email</a>;</strong> however, only those sent from a KCC email address will be considered.
<h2>Career Center Articulation</h2>
The <strong><a title="High School Articulation Form" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ArticulatedTechCourse1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Request for an Articulated Technical Education Course</a></strong> form must be submitted with a <a href="#costsheet"><strong>program cost sheet</strong></a> and a career center transcript. Note that at least one semester must be completed at KCC before articulation can be considered.
<h2>Available Online Module Content</h2>
Students can complete <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Industrial-Trades-Online-Modules-Reference-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>certain modules</strong></a> offered here entirely online. Once a student is registered, all content for these courses can be found entirely on <strong><a href="http://moodle.kellogg.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moodle</a>.</strong>
