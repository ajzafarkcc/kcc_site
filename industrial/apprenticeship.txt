An apprenticeship allows those interested in a skilled trade to learn the trade while also being employed. The teaching of the trade comes both from on-the-job training (OJT) and from related technical or classroom instruction (RTI).

Regulated by the Department of Labor (DOL), apprenticeships are sponsored by local companies and unions like the IBEW. Students interested in such an apprenticeship must apply for an apprenticeship through one of those organizations. The DOL Office of Apprenticeship provides <strong><a href="https://www.apprenticeship.gov/career-seekers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tools for finding open apprenticeships</a></strong> for those interested.

The RMTC works with the regional USDOL Office of Apprenticeship to assist companies in designing, registering, and implementing apprenticeship programs. All of our Industrial Trades curricula offerings can be used to develop the RTI of an apprenticeship program as recognized by the Office of Apprenticeship, including Tool and Die and Instrumentation.

<h2>Completion and Licensure: the Journeyman Card</h2>

Completing an apprenticeship earns a certificate of completion as well as the opportunity to become a journeyman. The journeyman is a signifier of someone dedicated to their chosen trade, and with licensing in certain states is capable of bidding for contracts and performing unsupervised work. In time a journeyman can even become a master in their trade. Earning a journeyman card demonstrates to prospective employers a certain level of skill and is very widely recognized.
