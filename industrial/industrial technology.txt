The Industrial Technology Program at Kellogg Community College trains students in the fundamentals of how to install, maintain and repair manufacturing equipment in a variety of settings, from the robotic machines that assemble products to the hydraulics and pneumatics that control mechanical motion. Simply put, this program will teach students how to figure things out.

It's designed for students who like taking things apart, solving complex problems, understanding how things work and don't mind getting dirty.

KCC offers the following Industrial Technology Program credentials:
<ul>
 	<li>Industrial Technology Certificate (30 credits)</li>
 	<li>Associate in Applied Science: Industrial Technology (60 credits)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Sequences</h2>
Unlike traditional academic courses, the offerings in KCC’s Industrial Technology&nbsp;Program&nbsp;consist of short modules that are components of larger units. Modules are often less than 1 credit apiece and can be completed at a student’s own pace in a matter of hours or days. Units range from one to 30 modules, depending on the area of instruction.

Industrial Technology modules carry the course designator INT as detailed in the most recent <a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FA21-Industrial-Technology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fall 2021 Industrial Technology Cost Sheet.</strong></a> Units in this program include:

<h3>RMTC Equipment &amp; Facilities</h3>
Across Michigan, there are few facilities like the Regional Manufacturing Technology Center, which KCC started in 1990 as a way to serve the workforce needs of the industries that are active and growing in south central Michigan. Thanks to an ongoing commitment from the College, private employers and local, state and federal agencies, the RMTC is a premier provider of industrial and skilled-trades education with highly experienced instructors and top-notch equipment. Machinery used for training at the RMTC is similar or identical to the equipment that students will use in the workplace.
<h3>Self-Paced Learning</h3>
Because of the self-paced instructional model at the RMTC, students can move at their own pace through the modules and units. As their work and life schedules allow, they can spend as many or as few hours each week learning alongside our instructors, who are available in labs day and night.

Please see the <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RMTC-Fall-2021-Lab-Schedule-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RMTC Fall 2021 Lab Schedule</a> </strong>for current available lab hours.
<h3>Prior-Learning Credits</h3>
Students who hold a journeyman or U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) apprenticeship certificate are eligible to receive prior learning credits that can be applied toward a KCC certificate or degree.
<h3>Tour the RMTC</h3>
Prospective students have an open invitation to visit the RMTC to take a tour of the facility, meet instructors and learn more about individual programs.
<h2>Instrumentation Modules</h2>
Students enrolled in Instrumentation modules&nbsp;at the RMTC will learn process control, measurement instrumentation, pressure measurement, force weight and motion in instrumentation, flow measurement, level measurement, temperature measurement, analytical measurement and final control elements.
