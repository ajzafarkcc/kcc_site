Through welding, heat is applied to metal pieces, melting and fusing them to form a permanent bond. There are a variety of welding processes, including stick, MIG and TIG. The Industrial Welding Program at Kellogg Community College prepares students to weld many different metals in various positions using each of these processes.

KCC offers the following Industrial Welding credentials:
<ul>
 	<li>Industrial Welding Certificate (25 credits)</li>
 	<li>Associate in Applied Science: Industrial Welding (60 credits)</li>
</ul>

 	<li><strong>Welding Students: </strong>Due to the risks presented by the COVID virus in sharing welding gear, all students will be required to provide their own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) going forward. Students will not be allowed to weld in the lab without this gear.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Where to Purchase PPE:</strong> Direct from local vendor – Airgas, <strong><a href="https://www.airgas.com/">https://www.airgas.com/</a></strong> or 2475 W Dickman Rd, Springfield, MI&nbsp; 49037, phone (269) 963-7929. <em>On your own</em> - It is recommended you verify with a KCC welding instructor whether an item is appropriate before making any purchases on your own.</li>
 	<li><strong>Required PPE:</strong> 1) Work boots/shoes (determined by student), 2) Welding helmet (Lincoln 1740 helmet or similar), 3) Welding jacket (green FR type jacket (not brand specific), 4) Welding gloves, 5) Oxy-fuel face shield (#5, not brand specific), and 6) Safety glasses (determined by student). Estimated cost excluding shoes $125 to $150.</li>

<h2>Course Sequences</h2>
Unlike traditional academic courses, the offerings in KCC’s Industrial Welding&nbsp;Program&nbsp;consist of short modules that are components of larger units. Modules are often less than 1 credit apiece and can be completed at a student’s own pace in a matter of hours or days. Units range from one to 30 modules, depending on the area of instruction.

Industrial Welding modules carry the course designator INWE as detailed in the most recent <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FA21-Welding.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall 2021 Welding Cost Sheet.</a></strong> Units in this program include:

<h2>Why Study Industrial Welding at KCC?</h2>
KCC offers a variety of American Welding Society (AWS) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) certifications, including shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). As part of the curriculum, KCC offers students vast amounts of hands-on training time in a state-of-the-art welding lab. As they learn to become expert welders, KCC students can expect to spend less time in the classroom and more time on the RMTC training floor mastering welding skills according to AWS standards.
<h3>RMTC Equipment &amp; Facilities</h3>
Across Michigan, there are few facilities like the Regional Manufacturing Technology Center, which KCC started in 1990 as a way to serve the workforce needs of the industries that are active and growing in south central Michigan. Thanks to an ongoing commitment from the College, private employers and local, state and federal agencies, the RMTC is a premier provider of industrial and skilled-trades education with highly experienced instructors and top-notch equipment. Machinery used for training at the RMTC is similar or identical to the equipment that students will use in the workplace.
<h3>Self-Paced Learning</h3>
Because of the self-paced instructional model at the RMTC, students can move at their own pace through the modules and units. As their work and life schedules allow, they can spend as many or as few hours each week learning alongside our instructors, who are available in labs during lab hours.

Please see the <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RMTC-Fall-2021-Lab-Schedule-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RMTC Fall 2021 Lab Schedule</a> </strong>for current lab availability.
<h3>Prior-Learning Credits</h3>
Students who hold a journeyman or U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) apprenticeship certificate are eligible to receive prior learning credits that can be applied toward a KCC certificate or degree.
<h3>Tour the RMTC</h3>
Prospective students have an open invitation to visit the RMTC to take a tour of the facility, meet instructors and learn more about individual programs.
