<img class="alignright wp-image-36212" src="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kcc-welding.jpg" alt="Kellogg Community College welding instructor Blaine Lautzenheiser welds at the college's Regional Manufacturing Technology Center." width="430" height="285">Welding is the most common way of permanently joining metal parts. Through welding, heat is applied to metal pieces, melting and fusing them to form a permanent bond. There are a variety of welding processes, including stick, MIG and TIG. The Industrial Welding program at Kellogg Community College prepares students to weld many different metals in various positions using each of these processes.

KCC offers a variety of American Welding Society (AWS) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) certifications, including shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). As part of the curriculum, KCC offers students vast amounts of hands-on training time in a state-of-the-art welding lab. As they learn to become expert welders, KCC students can expect to spend less time in the classroom and more time on the RMTC training floor mastering welding skills according to AWS standards.

KCC offers a certificate and an associate degree in Industrial Electricity and Electronics, as well as the more generalized Trades certificate and associate degree geared towards company-sponsored students.

<h3>Welding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h3>
Due to the risks presented by COVID-19, all students are required to provide their own PPE for use in the welding lab. Students will not be allowed to weld in the lab without this gear.

PPE can be purchased directly from <strong><a href="https://airgas.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airgas</a></strong>, who have a <strong><a href="https://locations.airgas.com/mi/springfield/airgas-store-n017.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">branch on Dickman Rd</a>.</strong> Contact the <strong><a href="mailto:welding@kellogg.edu">welding instructors</a></strong> if unsure about any equipment purchases.

The following items are needed, with an estimated cost of $125 to $150 excluding shoes.
<ul>
  <li>Safety glasses</li>
  <li>Work boots</li>
  <li>Welding helmet (Lincoln 1740 helmet or similar)</li>
  <li>Welding jacket (green fire-resistant type jacket, not brand specific)</li>
  <li>Welding gloves</li>
  <li>Oxy-fuel face shield (#5, not brand specific)</li>

<h2 id="sequences">Course Sequences</h2>
Unlike traditional academic courses, the offerings in KCC’s Industrial Welding program consist of short modules that are components of larger units. Modules are often less than one credit apiece and can be completed at a student’s own pace in a matter of hours or days. Units range from one to 30 modules, depending on the area of instruction.

Industrial Welding modules carry the course designator INWE as detailed in the most recent <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FA21-Welding.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall 2021 Welding Cost Sheet.</a></strong> Units in this program include:
