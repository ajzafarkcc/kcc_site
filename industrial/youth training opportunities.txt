The RMTC works closely with both the <strong><a href="http://branchisd.org/bacc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Branch Area Careers Center</a></strong>&nbsp;and the <strong><a title="Calhoun Area Career Center" href="http://www.calhounisd.org/cacc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calhoun Area Career Center</a></strong> to ensure youth have pathways to manufacturing careers. Pathways may include articulation and dual enrollment.
<h2>Articulation</h2>
Students interested in pursuing a career in Industrials Trades are encouraged to enroll in a program at one of the career centers during high school. Courses taken at the career centers may be articulated with the RMTC, which means high schools students may earn college credit prior to graduation.

Important! The RMTC Articulation Form differs from the traditional KCC Articulation Form
<h2>Dual Enrollment</h2>
High school students may also dual enroll at the RMTC. Dual enrolled students actually attend the RMTC and earn college credit, while they are still in High School. Dedicated students can graduate from high school and an Industrial Trades program at the same time.
