We work with high schools to allow their motivated students to start in the Industrial Trades while still in high school. Just as with all <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/admissions/high-school-dual-enrollment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KCC dual enrollment</a>,</strong> students earn college credit and make real progress towards a certificate or a degree. In the case of <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/admissions/earlycollege/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early college</a></strong> students, the student finishes high school with a credential, often with an additional year after traditional high school graduation.

The process for becoming a dual enrollment or early college student is much the same as for KCC in general:
<ol>
  <li>Speak with your school counselor about dual enrollment or early college.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/academics/departments/industrial-trades/students/#apply" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apply to the college</a>.</strong> Be sure to select the dual enrollment/early college options under the Academic Information section of the application.</li>
  <li>Meet with a Trades instructor to select modules and <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/academics/departments/industrial-trades/orientation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete orientation</a>.</strong></li>
  <li>Submit your module selection to your counselor for them to authorize the selection in our system.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/academics/departments/industrial-trades/students/#register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Register for modules</a></strong> and obtain course material.</li>
  <li>Start working like any other student.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="articulation">Career Center Articulation</h2>
Students may be able to take Industrial Trades courses during high school at the <strong><a href="http://branch-isd.org/bacc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Branch Area Careers Center</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="http://www.calhounisd.org/cacc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calhoun Area Career Center</a>.</strong> After enrolling and completing a semester at KCC, students are able to <strong><a href="https://www.kellogg.edu/academics/departments/industrial-trades/documents/#articulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">articulate career center courses</a>,</strong> earning college credit for the work completed during high school.
